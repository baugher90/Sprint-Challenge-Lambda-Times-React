         - Preprocessors - are an easy way to organize css and makes it easier to read and edit. however depending on the size of the App they can be unnessisary
         - Styled Components- Are extremly flexible and work similar to preprocessors without the added complexity. this tends to be an effective and effecient way to organize styling.
